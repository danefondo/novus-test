# Greetings Novus Studio!

## To run the app

```js
cd novus-client
npm run serve
```

## Notes

- As the desktop (1440px) and mobile (414px) views had a few differing elements, specifically, a different contact email address, a different company name in the Footer title and Copyright section, as well as the 6th section's image, I've set up conditional rendering, where once the screen reaches 414px in width, the elements are swapped for the ones displayed in the Figma mobile design, to ensure a match.
- I've omitted a duplicate word, 'our', in the 5th section description, which may alter the final text layout minimally.
- I've added a '.' to the second sentence in the Footer.

## Miscellaneous
